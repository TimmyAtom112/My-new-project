Hi, my name is Timilehin. Am currently learning pyhton and this is a new project i'm working on.
This is a chatbot that have worked on, and gives answers base on what it has in it database.
How it works :
    START
step 1: It greets the user and ask for the user's name
step 2: After the user has inputed his/her name, the chatbot will respond the user with a random greeting.
step 3: the user is then prompted to enter a command or ask a question for the chatbot to execute.
step 4: the chatbot then replies the user base on what the user has inputed, and search it database to see if it has an answer executable for what the user has inputed.
step 5: if what the user as entered can't be found, the chatbot will return a random response of either " please rephrase that", or "i didn't get that".
step 6: the user can exit the chatbot by typing "bye",or "goodbye". once the chatbot sees this, it respond the user with a random answer like "see you later"
step 7: End

Chatbot features: 
1. the chatbot has a greeting function: that greets the user once executed
2. the chatbot has a joke function: i.e it can tell a joke
3. the chatbot has a features that tells the current date and time
4. the chatbot has a features that replies to the user base on the user's input
